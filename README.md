### Automatic recognizing of the need for endodontic surgery from OPG (Orthopantomogram).

- When the pulp inside your tooth becomes infected, the only way to treat this issue and preserve your natural tooth is by removing the pulp from the tooth.
- Dentists can usually address this issue and repair the tooth using non-surgical (non-invasive) methods or root canal treatment (endodontic therapy). However, in some cases, there may be no solution other than dental surgery. 
- When treatment is performed, the pulp is removed from your tooth through the crown. When direct access to the pulp and root of the tooth is necessary, an incision is made on the gum.
- This method helps dentists to remove the pulp and infection through the tooth's root, and also eliminate infected bone tissue beneath the gum.

### In this project:

- Predicting patients' need for this surgery using OPG images and U-net.
- The data used has been annotated by experienced dentists and the input image format is DICOM.
